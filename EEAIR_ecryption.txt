Invalid user input (letters instead of numbers).

Solution: Added input validation using try-catch.

There were problems with Decryption on Vigenere Ciphere without some help 

Problem: Non-alphabetic characters (spaces, numbers) should not be changed.

I decided to add a check for Character.isLetter().


And as you can see I have big problem with GitHub
